# ProjectTextCraft
This project is a work in progress.

The overall project is a template for a text-based RPG within unity that allows for dynamic world building through procedural generation and quick iteration of items, npcs, environmental objects, and biomes.

Current stage of the project is the basics of the combat system with implemented gear and other common commands found in a text-based RPG.

Update[11/12/24]
- Data structure has been reworked to use dictionaries for entity data instead of scriptable objects. This allows for future proofing of dynamic AI and prevents potential bugs with data storage.
