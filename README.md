# ProjectTextCraft
This project is a work in progress.

The overall project is a template for a text-based RPG within unity that allows for dynamic world building through procedural generation and quick iteration via scriptable objects. 

Current stage of the project is the basics of the combat system with implemented gear and other common commands found in a text-based RPG.
